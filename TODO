* game should get harder as time passes... or as score increases?
    + probably score, since it shouldn't get harder as someone's just running
      for their life..

* extra lives at certain score(s) (200,000?)

* better intro screen with instructions

* high score table

* targeting reticule that can grow or shrink... another powerup/down?

* should enemies bounce off of each other? or blow each other up?

* powerup that nukes everything on the screen?

* powerdowns?

* multiplayer?
