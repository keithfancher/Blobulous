* what to do when player goes off-screen?
    + maybe limit the player to a smaller rect in the screen?
    + this would be good for multiplayer too... each player gets their own side
      of the screen
* score!
* dying should reset targets back down to the lower limit (2?)
* should enemies bounce off of each other? or blow each other up?
* actually show text and whatnot
* powerdowns?
* targeting reticule that can grow or shrink... another powerup/down?
* better collision... tighter hitboxes
* multiplayer?
