* extra lives at certain score(s)

* better intro screen with instructions

* better font(s)

* high score table

* targeting reticule that can grow or shrink... another powerup/down?

* should enemies bounce off of each other? or blow each other up?

* powerup that nukes everything on the screen?

* powerdowns?

* multiplayer?

* what to do when player goes off-screen?
    + maybe limit the player to a smaller rect in the screen?
    + this would be good for multiplayer too... each player gets their own side
      of the screen
    + for now just don't let 'em go off-screen

* fix weird input bug when screen loses focus
    + The problem is that the program only adjusts players speed/direction when
      a button is pressed or released. If you're holding up, the window loses
      focus, and you release up, the program won't know you've released it and
      the player will keep moving up. What we need to do is check the STATE of
      the keys at any given time, and adjust player movement based on that.
      Should make controls more fluid as well, though it seems less efficient.
      Alternatively, could just grab the keys...
