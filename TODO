* what to do when player goes off-screen?
    + maybe limit the player to a smaller rect in the screen?
    + this would be good for multiplayer too... each player gets their own side
      of the screen
* score!
* actually show text and whatnot
* real, non-square graphics
* powerdowns?
* targeting reticule that can grow or shrink... another powerup/down?
* multiplayer?
