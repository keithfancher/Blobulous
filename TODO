* fix weird input bug when screen loses focus

* better collision... tighter hitboxes

* should enemies bounce off of each other? or blow each other up?

* actually show text and whatnot

* powerdowns?

* targeting reticule that can grow or shrink... another powerup/down?

* multiplayer?

* what to do when player goes off-screen?
    + maybe limit the player to a smaller rect in the screen?
    + this would be good for multiplayer too... each player gets their own side
      of the screen
    + for now just don't let 'em go off-screen
