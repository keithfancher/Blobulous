I'm thinking this'll be like Rez meets Asteroids. Static play area, enemies and
powerups streaming in from outside. Hold down mouse button and drag across
enemies/powerups to target, release to fire.  Each powerup lets you target more
enemies simultaneously. The more you kill at once, the bigger the score
multiplier. Haven't decided if there'll be levels, or it'll just go on forever.
Each time you get hit, you lose a life and your max number of targetable
enemies/powerups gets reset. Lose all your lives, you're dead!

Anyway, this is just a prototype, it doesn't do much yet.
