Sort of like Rez (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rez) meets Asteroids?

Hold the down mouse button and drag across enemies/powerups to target, release
to fire.  Each powerup lets you target more enemies simultaneously.  The more
you kill at once, the bigger the score multiplier.  Each time you get hit, you
lose a life and your max number of targetable enemies/powerups gets reset.
Lose all your lives and you're dead!


CONTROLS:
---------
Arrow keys -- move player
Mouse -- move cursor
Left mouse button -- hold to target enemies, release to fire
Esc -- pause game, Esc again to exit
