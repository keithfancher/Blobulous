BLOBULOUS
=========

Sort of like Rez (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rez) meets Asteroids?


THE BASICS
----------
Hold the down the left mouse button and drag across enemies/powerups to target,
release to fire.  Each powerup lets you target more enemies simultaneously.
The more you kill at once, the bigger the score multiplier.  Each time you get
hit, you lose a life and your max number of targetable enemies/powerups gets
reset.  Lose all your lives and you're dead!


APESHIT MODE
------------
The max number of enemies you can target at once is 10.  Once you've reached
that and you collect another powerup, you enter APESHIT MODE.  You'll get
double points for all your kills until you lose a life.  (Apeshit mode is
indicated by a superfly new color scheme for your target meter.)

If you collect a powerup while in apeshit mode, you will earn a NUKE.  Right
click to nuke every enemy and powerup on the screen.  You will receive only the
base 100 points per enemy when you use a nuke -- no score multipliers, and no
powerups.  So make it count.  Also note: you can only hold 1 nuke at a time.

THERE'S ANOTHER GAME CALLED BLOBULOUS!
--------------------------------------
Yeah, I know. Turns out there are actually several games called Blobulous! I
picked the name randomly and didn't Google it beforehand. (Shame on me.) If
you're looking for a "social" game, or one whose gameplay is "limited only by
your imagination," you're probably in the wrong place. My Blobulous is
dangerously antisocial, and boasts a wide variety of unreasonable limitations.
Also, I'd prefer it if you didn't get your imagination anywhere near it.
