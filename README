I'm thinking this'll be like Rez meets Asteroids. Static play area, enemies and
powerups streaming in from outside. Haven't decided if screen'll wrap yet. Hold
down mouse button and drag across enemies/powerups to target, release to fire.
Each powerup lets you target more enemies simultaneously. The more you kill at
once, the bigger the score multiplier. Haven't decided if there'll be levels,
or it'll just go on forever.

Anyway, this is just a prototype, it doesn't do much yet.
