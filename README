BLOBULOUS
=========

Sort of like Rez (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rez) meets Asteroids?

Hold the down mouse button and drag across enemies/powerups to target, release
to fire.  Each powerup lets you target more enemies simultaneously.  The more
you kill at once, the bigger the score multiplier.  Each time you get hit, you
lose a life and your max number of targetable enemies/powerups gets reset.
Lose all your lives and you're dead!

Note: the max number of enemies you can target at once is 10.  Once you've
reached that and you collect another powerup, you enter APESHIT MODE.  You'll
get double points for all your kills until you lose a life.  (Apeshit mode is
indicated by a superfly new color scheme for your target meter.)
